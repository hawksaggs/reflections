What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Its create metadata of particular folder that contain files to track the versions of that files.
We need it bcoz if some bug may get introduce into our code we get restore it to previous working version of the code. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Before commiting the changes to the repository staging area offer intermidiate stage between final and initial stage in which we can decide what exact files we want to commit.
